# Smart Surveillance: Enhancing Elderly Safety

This project is an AI-powered real-time surveillance system designed to ensure the safety of elderly individuals. It uses object detection (YOLO), live camera monitoring, and automated alerts to detect falls, intrusions, and daily activity patterns.

## 🧠 Features

- 🎯 Real-time object detection using YOLO
- 🔔 Instant fall and intrusion alerts via Pushbullet
- 📹 Live surveillance stream via Flask Web App
- 📊 Logs for activity tracking
- 🛡️ Supports improved care and safety for elderly people

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Flask** (Web Framework)
- **YOLOv3** (Object Detection)
- **OpenCV** (Video Processing)
- **Pushbullet API** (Alert Notifications)
- **HTML/CSS** (Frontend Templates)
